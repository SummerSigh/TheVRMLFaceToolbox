# TheVRMLFaceToolbox
A repo for near mouth blendshape prediction


# You can get the model here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vd5nwN78Nx38RwTZFf0EtrGI9rhobtTf/view?usp=sharing

# How does this work?
Its pretty easy, grab the model, and put it in the same dir as main.py. Currently we are using a webcam as input, but you can use whatever you want as input

***This repo is a work in progress and currently only outputs raw tensor values and not blenshapes***
