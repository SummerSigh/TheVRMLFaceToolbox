# TheVRMLFaceToolbox
A repo for near mouth blendshape prediction

# How does this work?
Its pretty easy, download this repo and run main.py. Currently we are using a test video as input but you can use whatever you want as input!

- [x] - Add the Vive Model

- [ ] - Decompile SRanipal and figure out how Vive processes the output values from the model.

***This repo is a work in progress and currently only outputs raw tensor values and not blenshapes***
